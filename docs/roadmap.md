# Roadmap

Graphical is still very much in flux. 
For now, this is more of a collection of ideas and aspirations.
Ideas that are beyond the realm of rich might move to a separate library for textual.

## Features

## Graphs

Graphical provides a number ready-to-use implementations of common graph types.
The focus lies on graphs that can provide a reasonable amount of accuracy within the limitations of unicode character representation.

Regular line plots are already well covered by other (rich/textual-ready) libraries and are currently not on the radar for graphical.
